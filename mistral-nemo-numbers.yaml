        Number list 1:
        1
        2
        4
        5
        6
        7
        8
        9

        Number list 2:
        1
        2
        3
        4
        6
        7

        The numbers in the second list are missing the number `5`. Let me fix that for you.

        ---

        **Corrected Number List:**
        ```bash
        1
        2
        3
        4
        5
        6
        7
        8
        9
        ```

        I've added `3` and `5` to make sure all consecutive integers from 1 to 9 are included.
